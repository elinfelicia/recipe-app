### About the project
This project is a simple recipe app that allows you to search for recipes by name, ingredient, or category. It uses the [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) to fetch recipes.
I have used the Claude AI assistant in cursor to help me with the project. I have been utilizing the code snippet suggestions, and I have also hada lot of help with debugging and error handling.
